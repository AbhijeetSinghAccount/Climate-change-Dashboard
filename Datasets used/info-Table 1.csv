"In this report fossil CO2 emissions include sources from fossil fuel use (combustion, flaring), industrial processes (cement, steel, chemicals and urea) and product use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please note that in the analysis presented in this report no short cycle carbon CO2 is included in any sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"EDGARv7.0 includes IEACO2 emissions (IEA Energy Balances, 2020) for 1990-2019 from fossil fuel consumption and they are extended (FT approach) up to 2021 using BP statistics keeping the same sectoral breakdown. Updates up to 2021 for cement, lime, ammonia and ferroalloys production are based on USGS statistics, urea production and consumption are based on IFA statistics, associated gas used from flaring from GGFR/NOAA, steel production from world steel and cement clinker production from UNFCCC (2022). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CO2 emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector by EU27 countries and world macro-regions covering the time period 1990-2021 are presented. The LULUCF sector includes: Forest Land (Rossi et al., in prep.), Deforestation, Drainage of Organic Soils, Other Land use and their conversion (Grassi et al., 2022).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LULUCF emissions for the year 2021 are a copy of the previous year values. Compared to previous LULUCF versions, wildfire emissions are also included using the GWIS estimates (Global Wildfire Information System).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
